      <h3>Description:</h3>
      This project required me to build a website. On this page I have introduced myself and given a brief view of my interests and places I have been lucky enough to travel to. 
      I have also mentioned why I would like to proceed in a career of web development.

        This is a tribute page of a sport that I am very interested in.
        I have witnessed many great players walk these grounds who have come from the over side of the globe to play at one iconic venue...Lord's Cricket Ground.

        Here you will find the projects I have been working on. You are in fact on that very page. 
        In this project I was asked to develop a description card for each project I have worked on during my application for the course.

        The Movie Data is a project that I have worked on in applying for the Founders & Coders course. 
        I decided to build a user interface, being a form which allows the user to input data into a table displayed adjacent to it.
