        Hi, my name is David. Pending on the outcome of my application for the course that starts soon, I look forward to working with everyone. 
        My main interest is in coding; however, my other interests are in Cricket which I regularly follow and on occasions go to watch. 
        Football is another sport I regularly follow. I frequently attend football matches as I am a season ticket holder. Other than sports I like music and movies - especially sci-fi, action, horror, comedy, and docs.

        I have been lucky enough to visit both the East and West coast of Northern America and Canada. Most of my holidays have been in Europe which included several road trips.

      <h2>Why do I want to go into web development?</h2>
      <p>
        From an early age I have always been interested in computers. I have been the person to go to and solve technical issues wherever I have been. 
        I see myself as a problem solver which is important especially in web development. 
        I thoroughly enjoyed researching for this course. Parts of it have been challenging but I feel I have accomplished a lot whilst preparing.

      <h3>Matching Game</h3>
      <i>Each card has an exact match in the grid. Your aim is to find every match before the game is completed. If there is no match the cards will flip back to their reverse side.</i>
