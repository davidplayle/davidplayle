        <p>
         Lord’s is a stadium situated in St John’s Wood, London. 
         The ground was named after Sir Thomas Lord, who was a professional English Cricketer playing for Middlesex County Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) with a career which spanned from 1787-1802. 
         Whilst playing as a professional cricketer, Lord owned a site located on Dorset Square which is now known as Lord’s Old Ground where he once played for Middlesex vs Essex on 31 May 1787. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Thomas was approached by George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond in 1786. 
        They were the leading members of the White Conduit Club. 
        Their proposal was for Lord to find a more private venue for their club White Conduit. 
        In 1878 Lord purchased 28,000 square meters of his ground Dorset Square, which eventually lead to George Finch and Charles Lennox deciding to relocate to that very site. 
        This would soon form the famous Marylebone Cricket Club. 
        The lease on this ground ended in 1810 where Lord when was able to obtain an 8-year lease on two fields. 
        The first being the Brick and Great Fields at North Bank, St John’s Wood, and the second built a year earlier in 1809 which is today known as Lord’s middle ground. 
        This is where St John’s Wood Cricket Club would play. 
        In 1811 the MCC moved into Lord’s middle ground renaming St John’s Wood C.C as MCC. 
        Eventually in 1813, Parliament insisted that the plans for constructing Regents Canal would go ahead. 
        This would strike through the outfield of Lord’s Middle Ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Thomas Lord decided to relocate the field to the precise location that is used today. 
        Lord’s cricket ground opened in 1814, however Thomas Lord was not making enough money so asked for permission to develop part of the cricket ground for housing. 
        This idea would have meant that only 150 square yards of playing area was available. 
        The MCC member and Director of The Bank of England, William Ward, purchased the ground from Thomas Lord for £5,000. 
        The ground keeps its name today in honour of Sir Thomas Lord. 
        The ground is known worldwide as “The home of cricket”. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Sir Thomas Lord remained in St John’s Wood where he would later retire and moved down to West Meon in Hampshire. 
        He died in 1832.

        <h2>Who plays cricket at Lord's?</h2>
        <p>At the start of every season the MCC play the reigning county champions from the previous season. 
           It is the home of Middlesex County Cricket Club and every season the ECB hosts several test matches and One-Day Internationals. 
           Famous cricketers have played on these grounds. 
           Sir Donald Bradman of Australia who once held the record of the highest individual score from an overseas player proudly held that record for 73 years only to be succeeded by Graham Smith of South Africa in 2003 with a score of 259. 
           The highest individual score overall was by Graham Gooch in 1990 with an impressive 333 against India in a Test Match.</p>
  
        <p> It's not just the batsman who break the records at lords, players such as James Anderson recently became the all-time leading wicket taker at Lords with an astonishing 166 wickets in 26 matches. 
            This is followed by his opening partner Stuart Broad who is just one shy of 100 wickets. 
            For an over-seas player to perform consistently on each tour, takes a lot of guts. 
            Australian legend Glen McGrath took 26 wickets in 3 matches. 
            Both Tim Southee and Richard Hadlee have taken 24 wickets in 5 matches for New Zealand. 
            Then we have the great West Indian bowlers, Malcom Marshall 20 wickets in 3 matches, and Courtney Walsh 20 wickets in 4 matches. </p>

        <p>In 1903 the MCC took charge of the England touring programme. 
           Initially the MCC arranged a tour of England captain's James Lillywhite to tour Australia in 1877. 
           There they would play their first official test match against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
           On every tour the England team would represent the MCC when they played local teams. 
           This lasted until 1996, and on the 1st Jan 1997 the ECB (England Cricket Board) was established forming a single governing body to fulfil the roles which once belonged to the Test and County Cricket Club from 1968-1996. 
           Now players were on contracts. The MCC plays around 480 matches a year. 
           These are against schools, universities, and clubs. This also includes between 20 and 30 fixtures as part of overseas tour program to develop cricket abroad.
